  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    We are a local coffee shop located in Berkeley, California. Here at Caffeinated, we have a passion for coffee, beer, productivity, and community-building, and hope that Caffeinated is the final combination of all of these things.
  </p>

  <h3>A Haven for the Hungry</h3>
  <p>
    We have a wide selection of locally roasted coffee, craft beer, and teas. When it comes to our homemade pastries and dishes, we only use the finest, freshest, local ingredients.
  </p>

  <h4>Shindigs and Soirees</h4>
  <p>
    Not only are we into serving top-notch food and coffee to keep you fed and awake while you get sh*t done, but we're into creating an inclusive environment conducive to community-building, people meeting people, and all-around fun. To this end, we have events held on certain days of the week, every week - visit our <a href="events.html">events page</a> for more info!
