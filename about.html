      <div id="content-heading">About Us</div>
      <p>
        We are a local coffee shop located in Berkeley, California. Here at Caffeinated, we have a passion for coffee, beer, productivity, and community-building, and hope that Caffeinated is the final combination of all of these things.
      </p>

      <div class="heading">A Sanctum for the Studious</div>
      <p>
        As former students who used to slave away in cafes ourselves, we know the importance of having a great space to work. At Caffeinated, you'll find spacious seatings, as well as a variety of types of areas to work. Working in a group? We have large tables, round or rectangular. Studying alone together with friends? We have smaller booths and tables where you can sit across from your study-buddy. To seal the deal, we have fast, free Wi-Fi, and you can even borrow noise-canceling headphones from the cashier any time you please.
      </p>

      <div class="heading">A Haven for the Hungry</div>
      <p>
        We have a wide selection of locally roasted coffee, craft beer, and teas. When it comes to our homemade pastries and dishes, we only use the finest, freshest, local ingredients.
      </p>

      <div class="heading">Shindigs and Soirees</div>
      <p>
        Not only are we into serving top-notch food and coffee to keep you fed and awake while you get sh*t done, but we're into creating an inclusive environment conducive to community-building, people meeting people, and all-around fun. To this end, we have events held on certain days of the week, every week - visit our <a href="events.html">events page</a> for more info!
